a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

the location of files containing the dataset are represented using following variables:

test_x: the location of X_test.txt
test_y: the location of y_test.txt
train_x: the location of X_train.txt
train_y: the location of y_train.txt
subject_train: the location of subject_train.txt
subject_test: the location of subject_test.txt
features: the location of features.txt

the extracted dataset are stored in the following variables:

ttx: the variable used to hold the dataset extracted from test_x using read.table()
tty: the variable used to hold the dataset extracted from test_y using read.table()
trx: the variable used to hold the dataset extracted from train_x using read.table()
try: the variable used to hold the dataset extracted from train_y using read.table()
subject_tr: the variable stores the subject identity of training set
subject_tt: the variable stores the subject identify of test set
features_label: this variable stores the feature names for each variable in datasets


After extracting datasets from files, the training and testing set of x and y are jiont togather respectively using row wise combination namel set_x and set_y.

The joint X dataset and y dataset are then combined using column-wise operation as a dataset named set_all.

The actvity names are transformed into names from numerical values and appended to the last column of set_all.

The combind training and test subject names are stored in subject_all and appended to the first column of set_all.

The set_idependent varaible stores mean and std related variables in set_all grouped according to Activity and SubjectNames.

The set_old contains the Activity group in the first column, the subject names in the second column and mean value for repective variable in the remaining columns.
